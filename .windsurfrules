UI RULES:
1. Each robot component should show:
   - Robot name and type (e.g., "ðŸ¤– Robot Pink (BFS)")
   - Moves counter: "Moves: X/200" (where X is current moves)
   - Completion status: "Completed" or "In Progress"
   - Brief Explanation of the algorithm used
   - Grid display always in center of the cell and justified center with:
     * Robot emoji from props for robot's current position
     * ðŸ§± The Brick Wall Emoji for blocked cells
     * Numbers for visit count of each cell
     * 0 for unvisited cells
   - No progress percentage or completion status

2. Grid Styling:
   - Gray background for walls
   - Larger text for better visibility
   - Proper spacing and borders between cells
   - Responsive grid that fits the container
   - The Robot color should be used in the title
   - The Robot color should be used as the background color for the visited cells with lower intensity

3. Color Scheme:
   - Each robot can have a distinct color for its header and background
   - Keep the grid neutral (white/gray) for clarity
   - Use standard emojis for robot and walls
